### Who We are

Our company was established as the Agricultural producer's
Cooperative Corporation in 2004. Using biotechnology, we carry out the mushroom bacterium floor manufacturing and
grow mushrooms to ship elswhere to sell. The mushrooms are thick and soft and the usual smell has been removed so
people who don't like normal mushrooms can enjoy this new variety.

### Our Location

We are located in northern Japan, in Tsukidate City, Miyagi Prefecture. It is near Lake Izunuma, home of many beautify birds
that migrate here every year.
