### Who We are

The motto of our company is "safe food". Our company was established as the Agricultural producer's
Cooperative Corporation in 2004. Using biotechnology, we carry out the mushroom bacterium floor manufacturing and
grow mushrooms to ship elswhere to sell. The mushrooms are thick and soft and the usual smell has been removed so
people who don't like normal mushrooms can enjoy this new variety.

### Our Plants

We have more than 50 plants where shiitake are produced all year round. The temperature is kept stable thanks to bio energy.
